# Langchain

This project has an ipynb file as a notebook to solve different concepts of using the LLM models from OpenAI including the creation of Chains.

This further has a basic chatbot application (Q/A) using the openai model as gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct.
The front end of the application is created using the Streamlit.
